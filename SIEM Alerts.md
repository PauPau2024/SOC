### **Detection**

<span>SIEM alerts are notifications generated by the SIEM system based on predefined rules and correlation algorithms. These rules are typically customized to meet an organization's specific security requirements. When an event matches the defined criteria, the SIEM system triggers an alert.</span>

- **Severity** <span>: Indicates the level of severity, categorized as </span><span style="color: rgb(106, 168, 79)">Low</span> <span>, </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 229, 153)">Medium</span> <span>, </span><span style="color: rgb(230, 145, 56)">High</span> <span>, or </span><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0)">Critical</span> <span>.</span>
- **Date** <span>: Displays the date of the incident. (UTC +0 Timezone)</span>
- **Rule Name** <span>: Identifies the specific rule triggered by the event.</span>
- **EventID** <span>: Provides a unique identifier for the event.</span>
- **Type** <span>: Specifies the type of event or alert triggered.</span>
- **Action** <span>: Assigns ownership of the alert to you for further investigation and analysis.</span>

### **<span>Why Are Playbooks Important?</span>**

<span>As SOC analysts, we don't always know the exact steps to take when dealing with alerts. Playbooks help by providing a clear, step-by-step process to follow during an investigation. This is especially helpful for new analysts just starting their SOC careers.</span>
